It seems like you haven't provided any actual code for me to optimize. The input "/////adsasdads" doesn't appear to be valid code that I can work with.

To help you improve code performance, I'll need you to share the actual code you want optimized. Please provide the relevant code snippets from the files mentioned in your context (app.py, 3classes.py, or test.py).
